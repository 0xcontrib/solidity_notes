/* Variables

There are 3 types of variables in Solidity

local 
- declared inside a function
- not stored on the blockchain

state
- declared outside a function
- stored on the blockchain

global
- provides information about the blockchain

*/

/* Constants

Constants are variables that cannot be modified.

Their value is hard coded and using constants can save gas cost.

*/


/* Immutable Variables

Immutable variables are like constants. 
Values of immutable variables can be set inside the constructor but cannot be modified afterwards.

*/

/* Reading and Writing to a State Variable

To write or update a state variable you need to send a transaction. 
On the other hand, you can read state variables, for free, without any transaction fee. 

*/

/* Ether and Wei 

Transactions are paid with ether. 
Similar to how one dollar is equal to 100 cent, one ether is equal to 10^18 wei.
